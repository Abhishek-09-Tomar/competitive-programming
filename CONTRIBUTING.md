- Use **snake_case** for file names (e.g., `two_sum.cpp`)
- Each solution file should include:

  - Approach/Algorithm
  - Time Complexity
  - Space Complexity
- Example folder placement:

```
dsa/arrays/two_sum.cpp
competitive_programming/codeforces/contest_123/problem_A.cpp
projects/mini/project_name.cpp
```
