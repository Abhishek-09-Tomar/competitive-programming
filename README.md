# My-CPP-Journey 🚀

An open-source repository documenting my journey in **C++**, **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, and **Competitive Programming (CP)**.

This repository is beginner-friendly and open for contributions from anyone willing to improve, optimize, and expand solutions.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Master modern **C++17 / C++20** features
- Build strong foundations in **DSA**
- Solve problems from platforms like **Codeforces, CodeChef, LeetCode, AtCoder**
- Maintain clean, optimized, and well-documented solutions
- Create a collaborative **open-source learning resource**

---

## 👨‍💻 Who This Repo is For

- Beginners starting with C++ and DSA
- Competitive programmers preparing for contests
- Students preparing for coding interviews
- Open-source contributors interested in CP and algorithms
